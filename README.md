## Kirill Zabrodin

I am a software developer that has a passion for computer hardware as well as software. Having completed Makers Academy I am someone who is driven and has a real desire to learn and improve while contributing to an agile team. Processes are important to me as client satisfaction is my number one priority.

## Current Status

I am currently looking for work experience or an unpaid internship before starting a BSc in Computer Science in October.

## Skills

#### Coding

I'm a follower of TDD, agile process enthusiast, and lover of SOLID. Proficient in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Cypress, Jasmine, RSpec, Unitest, Rails, Express, Next.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Capybara, Travis CI, Heroku, NodeJS, Cypress and React. I learned all this at Makers Academy and in my own spare time. Here is a highlight of the projects I have done.

| Project       | Summary       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[Tweet Mood](https://github.com/kirillzabrodin/tweet_mood)|A Django application for understanding the opinions of Londoners|
| [Acebook](https://github.com/tomasdoh/acebook-floppy-disk)  | A two week Ruby on Rails project on making a basic facebook clone. A truly agile development process documented in the wiki and a fully tested app.  |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/kirillzabrodin/bank_tech_test)  | A short project displaying good documentation and SRP on a basic project. Fully tested with randomised tests and full test coverage.  |
|[Notes SPA](https://github.com/kirillzabrodin/notes-SPA)|The notes single page app is an interesting vanilla JS project that dived into understanding how React works and simulating some of its functionality. A testing framework was used to test it and it is deployed on heroku.|


#### Hardware

I have been interested in hardware for nearly as long as I have been coding. I built my first PC when I was 15 and have been tinkering with hardware projects ever since. I have done Unifi network deployments and have worked with Microtik and OpenWRT both in terms of deployment and router OS flashing. I have worked as an assistant sys-admin at Fusion Asset Management and learned much from my experience there.

- PC building, network deployment and Microtik scripting, sys-admin and hardware upgrade for Fusion Asset Management.
- A full hardware upgrade of 15 PCs with data transfer and backup storage. 

#### Public Speaking

Having competed at Model United Nations (MUN) for over 3 years and having won at 10 conferences I am used to audiences both large and small. I can prepare my own speeches and arguing my point of view succinctly and strongly. Due to my leadership position within my delegation I have experience at organising people and working under pressure.

- I won best delegate at 12 conferences and teams I was part of won best delegation at 10.
- I implemented a policy of checking each otherâ€™s resolutions prior to conferences to improve our performance.
- I managed and maintained a simple application for recording attendance of practice sessions for MUN.
